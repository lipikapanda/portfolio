### House Price Prediction

Model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

The model has also been deployed using Flask and Heroku for making real time predictions.
